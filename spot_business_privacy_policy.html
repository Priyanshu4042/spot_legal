  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 13 August 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use the 
    <strong>Spot Business</strong> mobile application (“the App”). This policy applies only to the Spot Business app 
    and not to the consumer-facing Spot app.

  </p>

  <h2>Purpose of the App</h2>

    receive and process order details, and manage reservation requests.

  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect sensitive personal data or use analytics in the Spot Business app.</p>

  <h2>How We Use the Information</h2>

    Business accounts are deleted immediately upon request.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell or share your information for marketing purposes.  
    Your data may be shared with service providers (e.g., MSG91) only as necessary to operate the App.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including secure authentication and controlled access.
    However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
